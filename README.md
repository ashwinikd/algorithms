# Algorithms and Data-Structures

This repo contains implementations of some basic algorithms and DS. This is a work in progress.
As of now following algorithms have been implemented:

* Sort
  * Insertion Sort
  * Merge Sort
  * Bubble Sort
  * Quick Sort
  * Heap Sort
* Heap
* Misc
  * Naive matrix multiplication
  * Inversion counting in an array
  * Maximum subarray problem
  * Binary search on sorted integer arrays

## Pending Algos
Following is the list of algos/ds which are not of my interest right now but I will implement
them some time soon.

* Strassen's Algorithm for multiplying n-by-kn and kn-by-n matrices
* Merge sort with insertion sort at small size
* Quick sort with insertion sort at small size

## Targets
* Documentation and comments
* Test cases
* Profiling
